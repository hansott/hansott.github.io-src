![Hans Ott](/images/hansott.jpg)

I'm a web & mobile developer with a strong interest in PHP, JavaScript, open-source software and domain-driven design. I'm deeply in love with clean code and I'll do anything to motivate other developers to leave the campground cleaner than they found it. You can find me on GitHub where I actively contribute to open source. I'm currently working at [Clarabridge](http://www.engagor.com/).

I also maintain a few packages myself:

* [hansott/pinterest-php](https://github.com/hansott/pinterest-php): PHP client for the Pinterest API
* [hansott/lastify](https://github.com/hansott/lastify): Syncs your music between Last.fm and Spotify
* [hansott/spotify-backupper](https://github.com/hansott/spotify-backupper): Creates backups of your Spotify library
* [hansott/psr7-cookies](https://github.com/hansott/psr7-cookies): Bakes cookies for PSR-7 messages
* [hansott/holidays](https://github.com/hansott/holidays): Returns the holidays for a country
* [hansott/range-regex](https://github.com/hansott/range-regex): Generates a regex for a range between two numbers
